# ExpFlattener

> Flattens the Minecraft EXP gain curve

This simple plugin takes the Minecraft EXP gain curve and completely flattens, making each level require the same amount of EXP to level up. The amount of EXP required is configurable, and the plugin also supports a level cap to prevent players from getting absurdly high levels of EXP.
